# ANIMATED UI

Simple animated ui extension. 

DOTWEEN is required.

I.Part UIAnimmatable:

Usage: Create a canvas(Image might work too), add UIAnimatable script to it and Play with parameters :) (Do not broke it please). To show view use Show(), to hide Hide() functions are enough.

Note: If you want to use fade fx, add canvas group to the object.

II.Part Progressor

Usage: Create an empty object and add Progressor script to it. Then\
  To use Filled Image as progressor, add ImageProgressorTarget \
  To use Animator as progressor, add AnimatorProgressorTarget \
to objects you wanted. Using SetValue(float) will animate.
